This action invokes the Gemini CLI.

**This is not an officially supported Google product, and it is not covered by a
Google Cloud support contract. To report bugs or request features in a Google
Cloud product, please contact [Google Cloud
support](https://cloud.google.com/support).**


## Prerequisites

-   This action requires Google Cloud credentials that are authorized to invoke
    the Gemini API. See [Authorization](#authorization) for more information.

-   This action runs using Node 20. If you are using self-hosted GitHub Actions
    runners, you must use a [runner
    version](https://github.com/actions/virtual-environments) that supports this
    version or newer.

## Usage

```yaml
jobs:
  job_id:
    permissions:
      contents: 'read'
      id-token: 'write'

    steps:
    - id: 'TODO'
```


## Inputs

<!-- BEGIN_AUTOGEN_INPUTS -->
<!-- END_AUTOGEN_INPUTS -->


## Outputs

<!-- BEGIN_AUTOGEN_OUTPUTS -->
<!-- END_AUTOGEN_OUTPUTS -->


## Authorization

There are a few ways to authenticate this action. The caller must have
permissions to invoke the Gemini API.

### Via google-github-actions/auth

Use [google-github-actions/auth](https://github.com/google-github-actions/auth)
to authenticate the action. You can use [Workload Identity Federation][wif] or
traditional [Service Account Key JSON][sa] authentication.

```yaml
jobs:
  job_id:
    permissions:
      contents: 'read'
      id-token: 'write'

    steps:
    - uses: 'actions/checkout@v4'

    - id: 'auth'
      uses: 'google-github-actions/auth@v2'
      with:
        workload_identity_provider: 'projects/123456789/locations/global/workloadIdentityPools/my-pool/providers/my-provider'
        service_account: 'my-service-account@my-project.iam.gserviceaccount.com'

    - id: 'gemini-cli'
      uses: 'google-github-actions/run-gemini-cli@v1'
```

### Via Application Default Credentials

If you are hosting your own runners, **and** those runners are on Google Cloud,
you can leverage the Application Default Credentials of the instance. This will
authenticate requests as the service account attached to the instance. **This
only works using a custom runner hosted on GCP.**

```yaml
jobs:
  job_id:
    steps:
    - id: 'gemini-cli'
      uses: 'google-github-actions/run-gemini-cli@v1'
```

The action will automatically detect and use the Application Default
Credentials.
